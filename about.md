Hello, I'm Gabriel Gonzalez and I made this blog to track and demonstrate my IT progress! I currently live in Los Angeles. My other passions include anything involving dogs (in fact, my favorite breeds are Borzois, Dachshunds, Dobermans, and Chihuahuas! My favorite dog sports are dock jumping, IPO/bitework, and obedience training!), video games, and fitness
