title: First blog post!
---

My first post will just lay out some of the projects that I intend to complete by the end of March, as well as the general purpose for this blog. The goals of this blog is:

- Record and track my homelab progress and updates
- Serve as a demonstration of technical skills in virtual labs 
- Informative networking/IT posts about various concepts as a means of showcasing understanding and research
- Any other miscellaneous updates 

There's a bit to unpack in these goals so let's see where I'm at currently in  each of them.

## Record and track my homelab progress and updates

Currently, there's not much news regarding my homelab, for I haven't quite pinpointed exactly what hardware I will be getting. I want to use my recently earned **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification to good use and get some old enterprise networking equipment such as switches and routers and lab out routing protocols such as **Open shortest path first (OSPF)** as well as examining layer 2 protocols such as **spanning tree procotol (STP)**. That's the tip of the iceberg of some things I want to test on physical hardware, and hopefully when I zero in on what I want to do I can list out my intentions. 

I also want to optimize, secure, and organize my home network and maintain a self-hosted server available to my family, perhaps an image-sharing service. By the end of March I will likely have my hardware ordered and my homelab network topology constructed.  

## Serve as a demontration of technical skills in virtual labs

In lieu of enterprise-grade physical hardware and hosts, this blog will also feature labs conducted in a virtual environment. Namely, GNS3 or even Cisco Virl. There's countless deployments and protocols that can be labbed out in the virtual environment, and I hope I can exhibit my technical skills in those labs with step-by-step guides filled information and alternative solutions.

By the end of March I want a couple of simple labs using virtualized Cisco hardware up on the blog. Most likely I will keep it simple and rudimentary and move on to more advanced concepts as time progresses.

## Informative networking/IT posts about various concepts as a means of showcasing understanding and research

Networking, and IT at large, is a massive sinkhole of knowledge that gets deeper and deeper. No matter your skill level, there is always something to learn, and the industry is evolving constantly with the introduction of new solutions and technologies. I want to constantly learn- and this blog is an excellent home to showcase what I have learned through online research. I expect to challenge myself with complex concepts, and I expect to be educational in reporting my findings. 

By the end of March I want to create at least one blog post about a technology. I will likely decide between STP, **Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)**, or IPv4/IPv6 addressing, and subnetting.

## Any other miscellaneous updates

Updates just like these, with no inherent educational purpose but important clarification.

So, I've set my goals and the purpose of this blog. Now it's time to lab and learn!
